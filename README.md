# What?

A simple script that print the menu page
of **RS Mess, ISI Kolkata** to your terminal, if you
are connected to their local network. I have added
some highlighting using grep for better readability.

# Installation
Just copy the shell script and make it an executable. Duh!

# Requirements
- curl
- w3m
